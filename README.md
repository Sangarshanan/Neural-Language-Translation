### GRU:

Gated recurrent units (GRUs) are a gating mechanism in recurrent neural networks, introduced in 2014 by Kyunghyun Cho et al.[1] Their performance on polyphonic music modeling and speech signal modeling was found to be similar to that of long short-term memory (LSTM). However, GRUs have been shown to exhibit better performance on smaller datasets
